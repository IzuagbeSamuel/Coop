    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is <b>Izuagbe Samuel</b> aka <b>Coop</b>, and I'm
      a student at <b> Ekiti State University</b> studying <b>Electrical
      & Electronics Engineering</b>, but that does not stop me from 
      going big on my dream. My dream is to become a<b> Cyber Security
      Consultant</b> and to do that I must be very vast in all <b>IT
      programs</b>, varying from <b>Programming Languages</b> to all part
      of <b>Management Information Systems</b>.</p>
      <p>I've done a lot of stuff, but I'm probably best known as 
        the founder of <a href="https//:IzuagbeSamuel.github.io/coop/">
        Coop Enterprise </a> one of the biggest student-focused blog
        on the internet. I also design websites and write for other blogs.</p>
      <p>Presently, I'm in a very big Coding Camp <i>To know more about this very Awesome
        Camp hit this link </i><a href="acedu.camp">Acedu Camp</a>. This Coding Camp is very good and very educative,
        presently I'm adding a lot of tools to my coding tool kit. <i>To check up on their website, do hit this link</i>
        <a href="acedu.camp">Acedu Camp</a></p>
      <p>I'm obsessed with enterpreneurship, human potential, and Programming.
        <b>Forex</b> (<i>Foreign Exchange</i>) is my major backup plan after Programming
        I've been trading forex for quite a long time and I tell you my losses 
        are all in 5% of my trades. <i>If you wish to view 
        all my previous work on Forex and Programming kindly hit this link</i> <a href="view.html">View Work

        <p> I live</p>
